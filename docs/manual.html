<p>User manual last updated June 26, 2014</p>

<article>


<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Overview of text-to-speech alignment</h2>

<p>"Text-to-speech" alignment is a speech processing task that is related to
the well-known "speech recognition" task. However, unlike speech recognition,
text-to-speech alignment requires the text that is pronounced to be already
known. All that remains to do is to align the words onto the speech signal,
i.e., find the milliseconds at which every word starts and ends in the audio
file.</p>

<p>This is very useful for example to synchronize the lips
animation of a cartoon character with the recording of an actor, or to
build "Karaoke"-like applications, or yet to quickly find where an utterance
occurs in a video database.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech alignment is technically easier to achieve than speech
recognition, thanks to the additional information provided by the (approximate)
transcription. Therefore, this technology is more precise and more efficient
than speech recognition for many corpora where the sound quality is not good
enough and where speech recognition fails.</p>


<h2>JTrans: Main features</h2>

<ul>

	<li>Integrates 3 levels of phonetisation: dictionary-based, rule-based
and decision-tree based.</li>

	<li>Generates alignments at the phoneme level and at the word
level.</li>

	<li>Handles alignment of simultaneous speech to some extent.</li>

	<li>Can export the resulting alignments to Praat.</li>

</ul>


<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>To run JTrans, you need the Java 7 runtime environment (JRE).</p>

<p>For developers: JTrans depends on the following libraries:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sphinx 4: automatic alignment.</li>
	<li>Gson: JSON I/O.</li>
	<li>juniversalchardet: encoding detection.</li>
	<li>Weka: automatic phonetisation.</li>
	<li>Tritonus and JavaLayer: MP3 support.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Getting started</h1>

<h2>How to run JTrans</h2>

<p>Run <tt>jtrans.jar</tt>. The first time you open JTrans, it will attempt to
download and install the resources it needs to function properly. This is a 55
MB download.</p>


<h2>Project structure: speakers and anchors</h2>

<p>A JTrans project consists of one or more <strong>speakers</strong>. Each
speaker has their own speech <strong>text</strong> (which may occur
simultaneously as other speakers). The text is peppered with <strong>timing
anchors</strong> to aid the alignment process.</p>

<p>Timing anchors are necessary, because, in "hectic" parts of a sound file,
JTrans may have trouble aligning every word. Placing manual timing anchors
tells JTrans where exactly a group of words starts and ends, and therefore
enhances the precision with which each individual phoneme is aligned.</p>


<h2>Workflow</h2>


<h3>Importing text markup</h3>

<p>JTrans can create a project by importing a file in either of the following
text markup formats:</p>

<ul>

	<li>JTrans's native format (.jtr). (This is a JSON-based format.)</li>

	<li>Transcriber (.trs). Anchors will be generated at the start and end
of each <em>Turn</em>, and for each <em>Sync</em> tag.</li>

	<li>Praat (.textgrid), assuming each tier maps to a speaker. Anchors
will be generated at the start and end of each <em>interval</em>.</li>

	<li>Raw text (.txt). You will need to create the anchors manually.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Importing a sound file</h3>

<p>After loading text markup, JTrans will attempt to detect a sound file
bearing the same name as the markup file. If it has found one, you will be
asked if you want to use it.</p>

<p>You can change a project's audio file at any time through <em>"File &rarr;
Load audio."</em></p>

<p><strong class="important">Please note that JTrans works best with WAVE files
	containing monaural PCM audio with a sample rate of 16 KHz and 16 bit
little-endian samples.</strong> JTrans can convert from a select number of
other formats for your convenience – notably MP3, OGG, and WAVE files with a
different sample rate – but the results are not guaranteed to be optimal.
<strong>For best results, please convert your audio files to the adequate
	format using a dedicated audio package.</strong></p>


<h3>Alignment</h3>

<p>When your project has both text and a sound file, you can try to align the
words to the audio track by clicking the <em>Align</em> button in the main
window, or the <em>"Align &rarr; Align..."</em> menu item.</p>

<p>Aligning a file for the first time typically takes about one minute. The
actual duration depends on the length of the file, the number of speakers, and
the power of your computer. Subsequent alignments will take less time because
partial alignments are cached.</p>


<h3>Saving and exporting a project</h3>

<p>Please note the distinction between the terms "saving" and "exporting":</p>

<ul>

	<li><strong>Saving</strong> means saving the project in JTrans's custom
JSON format (file suffix: <tt>.jtr</tt>). This ensures that no JTrans-specific
information is lost.</li>

	<li><strong>Exporting</strong> means saving the project in a foreign
format. By exporting to a foreign format, some JTrans-specific information may
be lost. Currently, JTrans may only <em>export</em> a project to Praat's format
(TextGrid).</li>

</ul>

<p>You can save or export projects in the <tt>File</tt> menu.</p>


<h2>Main window</h2>

<p>Speaker text is shown as parallel vertical bands in the main window (one
band per speaker).</p>

<p>Text is shown in cells arranged chronologically from
top to bottom. Each <strong>speech cell</strong> is delimited by two
surrounding <strong>time anchors</strong>. Speech cells contain text; text can
either be aligned (shown in blue) or unaligned (shown in red).</p>

<p>Anchors guide the alignment process as mentioned earlier.</p>

<div class="adapt">
<img src="window.png">
</div>

<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>One column per speaker. You may resize each column.</p>

<h3>Anchor</h3>
<p>Anchors guide the alignment process (see above for an explanation).</p>
<!--
<p>Right-clicking on an anchor will open a pop-up menu letting you adjust its
position or delete it.</p>
<p>Deleting an anchor causes the two cells around it to merge.</p>
<p>Please note that modifying an anchor will automatically clear the adjacent
alignment.</p>
-->

<h3>Speech</h3>
<p>The text in this cell is blue because it has been aligned. That is, JTrans
has computed the start time and end time for each blue word. Unaligned words
are displayed in red (not pictured here).</p>
<!--
<p>Right-clicking on a word lets you create anchors around that word.</p>
<p>Right-clicking anywhere in the cell lets you clear the alignment in this
cell.</p>
-->
<p>During playback, the currently-uttered words are highlighted (kind of like a
karaoke).</p>
<p>You may also left-click on aligned words at any time (whether the file is
being played back or not). Left-clicking on an aligned word selects it (shown
with a pink highlight), which moves the playback position to the word's
position, and updates the spectrogram.</p>
<p>Selecting an unaligned word has no effect.</p>

<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>This area is blank because the speaker is not uttering any words between the
two surrounding anchors.</p>

<h3>Spectrogram</h3>
<p>A graphical rendition of the sound around the currently selected word.</p>

<h3>Alignment timeline</h3>
<p>The timeline shows the aligned words and phones for the selected speaker
around the currently selected word.</p>
<p>Use the pull-down menu on the far left to display a different speaker's word
and phones in the timeline.</p>

<h3>Progress display</h3>
<p>During a long alignment, progress is shown here. Some operations may be
cancelled with the Abort button.</p>



<h2>Clearing/bypassing the cache</h2>

<p>JTrans caches partial alignments and converted audio files on disk. This
speeds up some tasks considerably.</p>

<p>However, if you work with a lot of different files, the size of JTrans's
cache can blow up quickly. You may safely clear JTrans's cache at any time to
save disk space. To do that, simply delete the contents of the
<tt>~/.jtrans/cache</tt> directory.</p>

<p>You may also want to <strong>bypass</strong> the cache temporarily,
especially if you are modifying a critical section of the program.  Pass the
<code>--bypass-cache</code> argument (shorthand: <code>-B</code> to JTrans on
the command line.  Objects won't be read from the cache, but they will still be
written to it.</p>

<p>You can also have JTrans delete any cache files it uses/creates with the
<code>--volatile-cache</code> argument. This is especially useful when aligning
batches of large corpora with limited disk space. Please note that turning on
volatile cache does not affect pre-existing cache files that are not used by
JTrans at the time of invocation.</p>




<h2>Anonymization of sensitive words</h2>

<p>Some corpora contain sensitive information such as given names, place names,
phone numbers, etc. If the transcription is 100% clear-text and the relevant
audio chunks are not bleeped out, you can use JTrans to produce an anonymized
audio file.</p>

<p>JTrans will align the whole file first &mdash; hence the need for a
clear-text transcription. Then, it will output an "anonymization track" using
the timing information for the sensitive words inferred from the alignment.
This anonymization track must then be fed to <a
href="http://sldr.org/voir_depot.php?id=526">a Praat script by Daniel Hirst</a>
in order to produce the anonymized audio file.</p>

<p>The standard syntax for sensitive words is as such (but it can be overridden
by markup loaders):</p>

<pre>*Alice* said, don't let *John* *Doe* eat the cake</pre>

<p>In the example above, the words <code>Alice</code>, <code>John</code>, and
<code>Doe</code> can be anonymized. Please note that there cannot be a space
character between two asterisks, e.g. this syntax will not work: <code>*John
Doe*</code>; please put asterisks around each separate word.</p>



<h2>Anchorless alignment</h2>

<p>Experimental. Only works with turn-based projects.</p>

<p>To showcase JTrans's alignment technique, you can try clearing all anchors
to have JTrans align the entire file without timing information.</p>

<p>Use Align &rarr; Clear anchors, then realign the file.</p>

<p>Warning: aligning a long file without any anchors may take a long time.</p>


<h2>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)</h2>

<p>Experimental.</p>

<p>First, load an audio file (File &rarr; Open Audio), then run ASR (in the
Process menu). The transcription will appear on screen as it is being
processed.</p>



<h1>Command line usage</h1>

<p>JTrans provides a command line interface for launching the graphical
interface and for aligning transcriptions without the GUI.</p>

<p>Please run <code>java -jar jtrans.jar -h</code> for more information about
the CLI switches.</p>


<h2>Launching the graphical interface from the command line</h2>

<p>Running the JAR file without any arguments, or without specifying an output
format, will automatically open the graphical user interface.</p>

<p>Sample use:</p>

<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar [MARKUP] [AUDIO]</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>MARKUP</code>: (optional) create a new project containing this
		markup file</li>
	<li><code>AUDIO</code>: (optional) set this audio file for the project</li>
</ul>

<p>If you provide a markup file but no audio file, JTrans will attempt to
detect an audio file with a similar name.</p>

<p>The parsing format is deduced from the markup file's suffix (jtr, trs,
textgrid).</p>


<h2>Aligning a transcription from the command line</h2>

<p>Sample use:</p>

<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar blah.trs blah.wav \
    --infmt=tcof --outdir=aligned \
    --outfmt=jtr --outfmt=textgridw</pre>

<p>This will align transcript <code>blah.trs</code> with audio file
    <code>blah.wav</code>, using the <code>TCOF</code> preprocessor.
    The result will be output in both <code>jtr</code> (JTrans) and
    <code>textgridw</code> (Praat TextGrid, Words only) formats
    &mdash; see below to learn more about available formats.
    Output files will be placed in the <code>aligned</code> directory.</p>

<h2>Available input/output formats (for <code>infmt</code>
    and <code>outfmt</code>)</h2>

<p>To get a list of the available input and output format codes for use with
<code>infmt</code> and <code>outfmt</code>, run:</p>
<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar --list-formats</pre>

<h2>Audio file auto-detection</h2>

<p>If the audio file bears the same name as the markup file (except for the
suffix) and both files are located in the same directory, you may use the
<code>-A</code> switch to auto-detect the audio file without specifying it on
the command line.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar -A blah.trs</pre>

<p>This will load blah.trs, along with any of "blah.ogg", "blah.mp3" or
"blah.wav".</p>

<h3>In detail</h3>

<ul>

	<li><strong>Turn-based</strong>: all speech occurs in turns. A turn has the
	same start and end time for all speakers. If several speakers speak
	simultaneously, all overlapped speech must occur in the same turn. (Such
	projects typically originate from Transcriber or raw text.)</li>

	<li><strong>Track-based</strong>: each speaker is assigned its own
	independent track.  In a given track, speech timing is not affected by any
	other tracks.  (Such projects typically originate from Praat.)</li>

</ul>

<p>The downside to turn-based projects is that overlapping speech is more
loosely delimited than what is possible with track-based projects. However,
<strong>turn-based projects may be aligned without any timing
information</strong>, and missing anchor times can be deduced. This is
<strong>not</strong> possible with track-based projects, which require
complete timing information to be useful.</p>

<p>Note: there is no functional difference between turn-based and
track-based projects that contain one single speaker. If you have a
single-speaker, track-based project and you need to align without timing info,
you should convert the project to turn-based.</p>


<h2>Overlapping speech management in TurnProject without any anchors</h2>

<p>When anchors are available, aligning overlapping speech is relatively
straightforward.  Each speaker is aligned independently from the others.
Overlapping speech is not really a problem here because we know what words are
being uttered thanks to the transcript, and we know approximately when they are
pronounced thanks to the anchors.</p>

<p>However, when anchors are not available in a TurnProject, overlapping speech
is a bit trickier. JTrans's strategy in case of overlapping speech is as
follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a long sequence of words, ignoring overlaps. In a turn with
	overlapping speech, drop all speakers except the one who utters the most
	words.</li>
	<li>Align that sequence normally.</li>
	<li>Infer turn start/end times (anchors) from the alignment.</li>
	<li>Align any still-unaligned speech thanks to the inferred anchors.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, assume we are facing the following situation:</p>

<table border=0>
	<tr>
		<th width="33%">Turn #0</td>
		<td width="33%"class="speech">moo moo</td>
		<td width="33%"class="empty"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Turn #1</td>
		<td class="speech">ribbit ribbit</td>
		<td class="speech">quack quack quack quack</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Turn #2</td>
		<td class="empty"></td>
		<td class="speech">meow</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Turn #1 contains overlapping speech.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Our word sequence will be: <strong>moo moo, quack quack quack quack,
		meow</strong>. We dropped "ribbit ribbit" temporarily.</li>
	<li>Align the sequence.</li>
	<li>We can now infer anchor timing for all turns.</li>
	<li>Align "ribbit ribbit" with the inferred anchors.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Format notes</h2>

<p>Some information about the formats that can be read/written by JTrans.</p>

<h3>JSON ("JTR")</h3>

<p>This is JTrans's "native" format. Its sole purpose is to easily 

<p>Please do not rely on this format for anything perennial. It changes
frequently. <span class="important">Do keep the original markup
files.</span></p>

<p>However, thanks to it being JSON, you can whip up a custom analysis script
fairly easily in your language of choice (as long as it supports JSON).</p>

<h3>Transcriber</h3>

<p>JTrans can load Transcriber files into <code>TurnProject</code>. JTrans does
not currently output Transcriber. JTrans supports the following features of the
Transcriber format:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Speaker names</li>
	<li>Turn start/end times</li>
	<li><code>Sync</code> times</li>
	<li><code>Who</code> tags (simultaneous speech)</li>
	<li>Comments/Events (please note that <code>Event</code> types are
	ignored)</li>
</ul>

<p>The following features are ignored:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Speaker metadata (accent, dialect etc)</li>
	<li>Ad-hoc alternate pronunciations (no standardized tag)</li>
	<li>Topics</li>
</ul>

<p>JTrans can open some non-standard flavors of Transcriber thanks to markup
plugins (a.k.a. "preprocessors"), e.g. <code>TCOF</code>,
<code>FrankenTRS</code>, etc. Reminder: use <code>jtrans.jar
--list-formats</code> to list all available markup plugins.</p>

<h3>TextGrid</h3>

<h4>Flavors</h4>

<p>There are 3 flavors of the TextGrid format:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"text file"</li>
	<li>"binary file"</li>
	<li>"short text file"</li>
</ul>

<p>JTrans only supports "text files". If your file is not in this format, you
can open it in Praat and save it to the appropriate format in the "Praat
Objects" window, then JTrans should be able to open it.</p>

<h4>Encoding</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, the TextGrid format does not specify a standard encoding.
Many different encodings are used in the wild. When opening a TextGrid file,
JTrans infers the encoding from its contents (thanks to juniversalchardet).</p>

<p>However, JTrans only <em>exports</em> TextGrid files as UTF-8.</p>

<h4>Praat display bug (missing boundaries)</h4>

<p>Praat seems to have a display bug (?) where boundaries are not rendered
before an empty interval. However, if you highlight an interval with a
"missing" boundary, its boundaries become apparent.</p>

<h4>Exported intervals</h4>

<p>Word intervals include the silence that follows the word (if any). You can
observe this with a "words+phones" output.</p>

<p>Words that couldn't be aligned are exported as 0-length intervals where they
are expected to be. (However, this should be fairly rare and only occurs when
the interval given to JTrans for a phrase is too short to fit a
StateGraph.)</p>

<p>Non-alignable elements (i.e. comments) are exported to TextGrid as 0-length
intervals whose text is surrounded with square brackets <code>[]</code>. They
are "glued" to a neighboring interval. Being 0-length, they are not visible in
the Praat GUI, but still there in the TextGrid file. Example:

<pre>
    intervals [141]:
        xmin = 42.422
        xmax = 42.422
        text = "[hhh]"
</pre>

<p>Any metadata about the comment is lost, however; e.g. whether the comment
denotes noise, etc.</p>
