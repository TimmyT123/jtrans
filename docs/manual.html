<h1>JTrans: text-to-speech alignment software</h1>
<h1>User Manual</h1>

<article>


<h2>Overview of text-to-speech alignment</h2>

<p>"Text-to-speech" alignment is a speech processing task that is related to
the well-known "speech recognition" task. However, unlike speech recognition,
text-to-speech alignment requires the text that is pronounced to be already
known. All that remains to do is to align the words onto the speech signal,
i.e., find the milliseconds at which every word starts and ends in the audio
file.</p>

<p>This is very useful for example to synchronize the lips
animation of a cartoon character with the recording of an actor, or to
build "Karaoke"-like applications, or yet to quickly find where an utterance
occurs in a video database.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech alignment is technically easier to achieve than speech
recognition, thanks to the additional information provided by the (approximate)
transcription. Therefore, this technology is more precise and more efficient
than speech recognition for many corpora where the sound quality is not good
enough and where speech recognition fails.</p>


<h2>JTrans: Main features</h2>

<ul>

	<li>Integrates 3 levels of phonetisation: dictionary-based, rule-based
and decision-tree based.</li>

	<li>Generates alignments at the phoneme level and at the word
level.</li>

	<li>Handles alignment of simultaneous speech to some extent.</li>

	<li>Can export the resulting alignments to Praat.</li>

</ul>


<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>To run JTrans, you need the Java 7 runtime environment (JRE).</p>

<p>For developers: JTrans depends on the following libraries:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sphinx 4: automatic alignment.</li>
	<li>Gson: JSON I/O.</li>
	<li>juniversalchardet: encoding detection.</li>
	<li>Weka: automatic phonetisation.</li>
	<li>Tritonus and JavaLayer: MP3 support.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How to run JTrans</h2>

<p>Run <tt>jtrans.jar</tt>. The first time you open JTrans, it will attempt to
download and install the resources it needs to function properly. This is a 400
MB download.</p>


<h2>Project structure</h2>

<p>A JTrans project consists of <strong>parallel* speaker tracks</strong>, each
of which containing <strong>text</strong>. The text is peppered with
<strong>timing anchors</strong> to aid the alignment process**.</p>

<p>* "Parallel" means that several speakers may speak simultaneously.</p>

<p>** In "hectic" parts of a sound file, JTrans may have trouble aligning every
word. Placing manual timing anchors tells JTrans where exactly a group of words
starts and ends, and therefore enhances the precision with which each
individual phoneme is aligned.</p>


<h2>Workflow</h2>


<h3>Importing text markup</h3>

<p>JTrans can create a project by importing a file in either of the following
text markup formats:</p>

<ul>

	<li>JTrans's native format (.jtr). (This is a JSON-based format.)</li>

	<li>Transcriber (.trs). Anchors will be generated at the start and end
of each <em>Turn</em>, and for each <em>Sync</em> tag.</li>

	<li>Praat (.textgrid), assuming each tier maps to a speaker. Anchors
will be generated at the start and end of each <em>interval</em>.</li>

	<li>Raw text (.txt). You will need to create the anchors manually.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Importing a sound file</h3>

<p>After loading text markup, JTrans will attempt to detect a sound file
bearing the same name as the markup file. If it has found one, you will be
asked if you want to use it.</p>

<p>You can change a project's audio file at any time through <em>"File &rarr;
Load audio."</em></p>

<p><strong class="important">Please note that JTrans works best with WAVE files
	containing monaural PCM audio with a sample rate of 16 KHz and 16 bit
little-endian samples.</strong> JTrans can convert from a select number of
other formats for your convenience – notably MP3, OGG, and WAVE files with a
different sample rate – but the results are not guaranteed to be optimal.
<strong>For best results, please convert your audio files to the adequate
	format using a dedicated audio package.</strong></p>


<h3>Alignment</h3>

<p>When your project has both text and a sound file, you can try to start
aligning.</p>

<p>If your project contains <strong>anchors</strong>, you can align the words
by clicking the <em>Align</em> button in the main window, or via the <em>"Align
&rarr; Auto-align between anchors"</em> menu item.</p>

<p>If the project does not contain any anchors, you can start an alignment via
the <em>"Align &rarr; Auto-align all (no anchors)".</em> Please bear in mind
that, without any anchors, an alignment will probably be sub-optimal.</p>

<p>Aligning a file for the first time takes about one minute. The actual
duration depends on the length of the file, the number of speakers,
and the power of your computer. Subsequent alignments will take less time
because partial alignments are cached.</p>


<h3>Saving and exporting a project</h3>

<p>Please note the distinction between the terms "saving" and "exporting":</p>

<ul>

	<li><strong>Saving</strong> means saving the project in JTrans's custom
JSON format (file suffix: <tt>.jtr</tt>). This ensures that no JTrans-specific
information is lost.</li>

	<li><strong>Exporting</strong> means saving the project in a foreign
format. By exporting to a foreign format, some JTrans-specific information may
be lost. Currently, JTrans may only <em>export</em> a project to Praat's format
(TextGrid).</li>

</ul>

<p>You can save or export projects in the <tt>File</tt> menu.</p>


<h2>Main window</h2>

<p>Each speaker is assigned a distinct <strong>speech track</strong>. Speech
tracks are shown as parallel vertical bands in the main window.</p>

<p>Tracks contain text shown in cells arranged chronologically from
top to bottom. Each <strong>speech cell</strong> is delimited by two
surrounding <strong>time anchors</strong>. Speech cells contain text; text can
either be aligned (shown in blue) or unaligned (shown in red).</p>

<p>Anchors guide the alignment process as mentioned earlier.</p>

<h2>Command line use</h2>

<p>JTrans provides a command line interface for launching the graphical
interface and for aligning transcriptions without the GUI.</p>

<p>Please run <code>java -jar jtrans.jar -h</code> for more information about
the CLI switches.</p>


<h3>Launching the graphical interface from the command line</h3>

<p>Running the JAR file without any arguments, or without specifying an output
format, will automatically open the graphical user interface.</p>

<p>Sample use:</p>

<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar [MARKUP] [AUDIO]</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code>MARKUP</code>: (optional) create a new project containing this
		markup file</li>
	<li><code>AUDIO</code>: (optional) set this audio file for the project</li>
</ul>

<p>If you provide a markup file but no audio file, JTrans will attempt to
detect an audio file with a similar name.</p>

<p>The parsing format is deduced from the markup file's suffix (jtr, trs,
textgrid).</p>


<h3>Aligning a transcription from the command line</h3>

<p>Sample use:</p>

<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar blah.trs blah.wav \
    --infmt=TCOFWhoifier --outdir=aligned \
    --outfmt=jtr --outfmt=textgridw</pre>

<p>This will align transcript <code>blah.trs</code> with audio file
    <code>blah.wav</code>, using the <code>TCOFWhoifier</code> preprocessor.
    The result will be output in both <code>jtr</code> (JTrans) and
    <code>textgridw</code> (Praat TextGrid, Words only) formats
    &mdash; see below to learn more about available formats.
    Output files will be placed in the <code>aligned</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Available input/output formats (for <code>infmt</code>
    and <code>outfmt</code>)</h3>

<p>To get a list of the available input format codes for use with
    <code>infmt</code>, run:</p>
<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar --list-infmt</pre>

<p>To get a list of the available output format codes for use with
    <code>outfmt</code>, run:</p>
<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar --list-outfmt</pre>

<h3>Audio file auto-detection</h3>

<p>If the audio file bears the same name as the markup file (except for the
suffix) and both files are located in the same directory, you may use the
<code>-A</code> switch to auto-detect the audio file without specifying it on
the command line.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>java -jar jtrans.jar -A blah.trs</pre>

<p>This will load blah.trs, along with any of "blah.ogg", "blah.mp3" or
"blah.wav".</p>

<h2>Clearing/bypassing the cache</h2>

<p>JTrans caches partial alignments and converted audio files on disk. This
speeds up some tasks considerably.</p>

<p>However, if you work with a lot of different files, the size of JTrans's
cache can blow up quickly. You may safely clear JTrans's cache at any time to
save disk space. To do that, simply delete the contents of the
<tt>~/.jtrans/cache</tt> directory.</p>

<p>You may also want to <strong>bypass</strong> the cache temporarily,
especially if you are modifying a critical section of the program.  Pass the
<code>--bypass-cache</code> argument (shorthand: <code>-B</code> to JTrans on
the command line.  Objects won't be read from the cache, but they will still be
written to it.</p>
