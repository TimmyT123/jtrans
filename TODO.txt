PRIO	TASK
============

1	Non-regression tests (no GUI but command-line scripts) to check TCOF / ORFOM / simultaneous speakers / ?...
1	Export non-alignable elements to TextGrid point tiers

2	Get rid of REIMPLEMENT_DEC2013()
2	Threaded alignment process
2	Reintroduce auto transcript

3	Align 1 word between 2 anchors -> no phones
3	Avoid writing tiny JSGF grammars on disk

4	New function: anonymize audio from XML tag that identifies proper nouns
	WARNING: we must just pass to a Praat script the alignment info for proper nouns.
	The Praat script will do the job of modifying the audio file.

4	Support alignment of long files without any anchors !!
	Long-term but very important and very challenging: possible ways to do it (to discuss):
	- confidence measures, e.g., finding common inter-systems word sequences
	- unsupervised model-free alignment *** (preferred ? ==> paper)

7	Alignment perf evaluation (we have to wait for a gold seg for that)

9	Port to English (English models)
9	New function: computer assisted transcription
9	New function: acoustic model adaptation
9	New function: language model adaptation
